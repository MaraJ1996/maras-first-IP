    <p style="font-family:verdana;"><img src="css/Woodman.jpg" alt="Black and White photo" align="left" width=40%> Welcome. Here's a bit about me: Mara Jackson is a recent college graduate with a Bachelor's degree in English Literature and Studio Art, including a minor study in film. Through college I worked as a child caretaker, in food service and as an art gallery exhibition intern. After graduating in May of 2018, I relocated to Kenya to work as a digital content intern for a couple months. Afterwards, I enrolled in Moringa Schools. I chose to enroll in a programming course because I had the time and had always wanted to take a coding class. I had hoped this course would give me knowledge needed to be able to pursue software design, even as just a hobby. I have interests in pursuing a career involving entertainment law while still focusing on my artistic strengths, i.e. photography, printmaking and music.
